# Available Reads Fork
Displays listings on Goodreads of loan availability of ebooks and audiobooks through your local library's Overdrive account.

This fork adds import and export functionality, and makes links point to Libby instead of Overdrive. Currently, this fork can only be built manually.

I primarily test on Kiwi Browser on Android.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/holyspiritomb/goodreads goodreads
cd goodreads
cd build
```

For chromium based browsers:

```
./build_chrome.sh
```

For Firefox based browsers:

```
./build_firefox.sh
```
